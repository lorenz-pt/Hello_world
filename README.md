# Hello_world
A repository that I'm creating to start learning git-hub.

Hi, I'm Lorenzo and I'm new to Git-hub. I'm following the tutorial on how to create and manage repositories.
My future goal is to post a code I made in Matlab (and that hopefully I will be able to implement in Fortran) for my Thesis.
